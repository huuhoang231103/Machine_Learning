# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains various machine learning projects and implementations, focusing on classification, regression, and recommendation systems. The projects utilize popular machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), as well as data manipulation and visualization libraries.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world problems, focusing on data-driven decision-making processes. The main feature of this project is evaluating and recommending items based on user preferences, utilizing machine learning algorithms for prediction.

### Key Features:
- **Item evaluation system**: Predicts the suitability of items based on user preferences and historical data.
- **Classification models**: Uses algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to categorize data.
- **Data scaling**: Implements feature scaling using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`.
- **Model evaluation**: Includes tools to evaluate the model using cross-validation, accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- **Graphical user interface (GUI)**: A Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to interact with the models and visualize results.

## Requirements

To run the projects in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tkinter`
